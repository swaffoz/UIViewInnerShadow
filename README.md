UIViewInnerShadow
=================

A UIView Extension that allows you to apply an inner shadow without having to get your hands dirty.
This project is more-or-less a Swift port of Philip Yu's [UIView-Shadow-Maker](https://github.com/Seitk/UIView-Shadow-Maker).

## Installation
Copy the `UIViewInnerShadow/UIViewInnerShadow.swift` file into your project in XCode and you're done. Aren't extensions neat?

## License

## Example Usage
Example use can be found in `UIViewInnerShadow/ShadowDemoViewController.swift`
